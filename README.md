# Webscraping_Project
This is a project to extract data to create a dataset of elements with characteristic elemental descriptors. 
Data reduction methods were used to reduce the dimensionality of the property space. Hence, only five (5)
elemental descriptors are being used  for the prediction of band gap energies of compounds.
